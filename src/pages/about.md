Hi

Glad you’re here.
I don’t know how you got here, but I’m glad you did. My name is Samuel, currently SWE @Buildable, based in Barranquilla, Colombia. I also happen to be an Electronic Engineer from the Universidad del Norte⚡️. This little corner on the internet is about what I love the most… programming and reading. My motivation behind this blog is not to get famous but to show you a little bit of me and connect with you. That’s why there’s a newsletter. Feel free to subscribe and answer (I won’t send you any spam, I hate it too). Hope you all are having a calm and restful day. See you.
