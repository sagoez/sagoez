This is a log of me going through the [Comprehensive Rust](https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/running-the-course/course-structure.html)
four days course. There's no structure to this, so be prepared for a lot of rambling and writing... or not üòù. **This log will be updated as I go through the course.**

Some key concepts to keep in work with Rust:

- rustc: the Rust compiler which turns .rs files into binaries and other intermediate formats.
- cargo: the Rust dependency manager and build tool. Think of it as the npm of Rust.
- rustup: This tool is used to install and update rustc and cargo when new versions of Rust is released. In addition, rustup can also download documentation for the standard library. You can have multiple versions of Rust installed at once and rustup will let you switch between them as needed.

Also [here](https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/cargo/rust-ecosystem.html#speaker-notes-open) you can find some speaker notes
